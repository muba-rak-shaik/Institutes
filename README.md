**Development Process:**

1. **Requirements Gathering:**
   - Identify project stakeholders, including administrators, students, and instructors.
   - Collaborate with educational institutions to define specific requirements.
   - Document functional and non-functional requirements.

2. **Database Design:**
   - Design the database schema with appropriate tables, relationships, and constraints.
   - Define primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.
   - Incorporate CHECK constraints for location verification.

3. **Front-End Development:**
   - Develop a user-friendly web or desktop interface for administrators, students, and instructors.
   - Implement forms and views for data entry and retrieval.

4. **Back-End Development:**
   - Create server-side logic for handling data transactions.
   - Implement SQL queries and stored procedures for database interactions.
   - Develop APIs for communication between the front-end and back-end.

5. **Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
   - Ensure system functionality, security, and performance meet the defined requirements.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the system on a secure and reliable server infrastructure.
   - Set up a database server to host the learning institutes' data.

7. **User Training and Adoption:**
   - Provide training sessions for administrators, instructors, and students to use the system effectively.

8. **Maintenance and Updates:**
   - Continuously monitor and maintain the system.
   - Address issues, implement enhancements, and perform regular backups.
